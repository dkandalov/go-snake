### What is this?
This is a minimal [snake game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) 
with [ncurses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses) UI 
written in [Go](https://golang.org).
It is an attempt to re-implement [Kotlin/Native snake](https://github.com/dkandalov/kotlin-native-snake),
therefore, some design decisions might not be idiomatic. 

### How to use?
 - install Go (e.g. by following [installation instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install))
 - see `makefile` to execute targets from it
